This repository holds the source and slides for a talk I am giving 
at our local functional programming users group.

Its covers in introduction to some of the typeclasses in the Typeclasopedia. The classes covered are
Functor, Applicative and Monoid. They are covered as a little theory and then a practical example of their
use in the form of an ASCII art renderer and a basic little battleship / mine sweeper clone.

The slides are written as literate Haskell in `Slides.lhs` and produces a 
literate Haskell HTML presentation as `index.html` using Pandoc. The slides are
directly hosted on GitHub using GutHub Pages at <http://hanstolpo.github.io/HaskellTalk_Intro_Typeclassopedia>
