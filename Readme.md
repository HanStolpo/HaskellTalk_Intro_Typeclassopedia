This repository holds the source and slides for a talk I am giving 
at our local functional programming users group.

Its going to cover some basics of Haskell and then cover a few type classes
from the Typeclassopedia.

The slides are written as literate Haskell in `Slides.lhs` and produces a 
literate Haskell HTML presentation as `Slides.html` using Pandoc.
